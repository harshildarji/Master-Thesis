Topic: **Investigating Sparsity in Recurrent Neural Networks**

This Master's thesis focuses on examining the effects of sparsity in Recurrent Neural Networks. This is an important research area that focuses on the optimization of Recurrent Neural Networks by reducing the complexity of their internal architecture while maintaining the original performance.  For this reason, I developed custom Recurrent Neural Network models using PyTorch,  which allows me to operate on weight matrices.
